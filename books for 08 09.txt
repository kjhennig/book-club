1. IceFields:  Interesting book on the history of the Banff/Jasper area in 
Alberta.  The descriptions were fantastic .. the characterization not so great, 
the story, ho hum, but some interesting ideas.  I would never read it again, 
but it was okay.

2. King Leary: Book on hockey, comedy.  Most of the group loved it, I didn't 
like it.

3. The Mother Tongue: FANTASTIC non-fiction book on the history of the English 
Language.  One of those books I keep by my bed to dip into just for fun. 

4. The Romantic: Oh, WHEN will women finally stop writing about the tragic 
loves in their early life?  I don't care and I don't think you are a wonderful 
woman because you hang on to a flawed man who puts you through hell.  Grow some 
back bone, sister, drop the loser and find someone who will treat you well.

5. Madam Bovary: I am SO glad I read this.  Interesting, funny, charming, 
compelling, AND a classic!  Also, so glad we read it for bookclub because I got 
so much out of other people's perceptions of the book as well.

6. Slammerkin: Chic lit book masquerading as good historical fiction.  You got 
the feeling that the author had done a lot of research on the period and, by 
gar (to use a Jerome term) she was going to put all of it into the novel even 
if it had nothing to do with the story.

7. Evidence of Things Unseen: One of the best books I've read in the last 10 
years.   It is worth a read (for you)  and I will re-read it in about 10 years 
because I think it is a book which appeals to different ages for different 
reasons.  I am SO glad I read it!!!
